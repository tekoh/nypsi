# scratch cards

## how do they work

scratch cards work just as you would expect them to do `/use <scratch card>` to use a scratch card.
to win, you must get 3 in a row (horizontally or vertically).

## how do i get them

you can get a daily scratch card from doing `/daily` each day, you will always get one.

you can also get the corner shop scratch card by buying it from the shop with `/buy`

there are 3 other scratch cards which you can only get by luck, or from achievements. these are the
lucky scratch card, karma scratch card and the legendary scratch card.
