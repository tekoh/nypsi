# guilds

## what are guilds

guilds work similarly to how they do on hypixel. you create your own guild, invite friends, and work together to level it up.

## whats the point of a guild

being in a guild that has been levelled up gives you rewards. these rewards are as follows:

-   +**1** max xp gain when gambling for each level
-   +**1**% multiplier for each level

as well as these upgrades, all members will receive basic crates when upgrading the guild

## how do i upgrade my guild

your guild will upgraded automatically, once the requirements have been met. you can do `$guild upgrade` to look at the
requirements for the next upgrade

## guild members

at first, a guild can only hold 3 members. this will increase when the guild upgrades, allowing for more members. although
note, with more members, the requirements to upgrade the guild are higher.

to leave your guild, use the `$guild leave` command. if you are the owner however, you will need to delete your guild, using
`$guild delete`

## how can i get my money back after depositing?

this is not possible, as it could easily be abused. however, when the guild is deleted, each member will receive a percentage
back of what they contributed to the guild
