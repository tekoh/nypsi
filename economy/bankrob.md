# bankrob

## banks

different banks have different default balance, the higher prestige you are, the more banks you will
unlock with each having a higher default balance

## no available banks

this means that all banks' (available to you) balances are too low to be robbed, so you cannot
bankrob. to get past this, progress to a higher prestige to unlock more banks

## lawyers

lawyers help you to not lose as much money as you would. when robbing players however, you will lose
no money if you fail.
