# lottery

## how it works

the nypsi lottery runs every day at 12:00am utc. you can see the countdown for this in `/lottery tickets`. this will also
show you what tickets you own.

## how do i get tickets

you can get tickets by buying them with `/lottery buy`. or from voting. you can get 5 lottery tickets for free when you vote
for nypsi, which will give you a pretty decent chance at winning (:
