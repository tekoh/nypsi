# seasons

## what are seasons?

a nypsi season will typically last between around 4-6 months. at the end of the season, an _economy reset_ takes place, where
everything **except prestige and karma** is reset for every user. any banned users will also be unbanned, but will be
completely reset. meaning prestige 0.

## why?

its a good way to keep economy fresh and under control ðŸ™‚. and at the end of every season, the top 5 balancesm globally get
rewards, such as nypsi premium & real money
