# workers

## what do workers do

workers passively earn money for you, meaning that you will be making money by doing nothing,
however you still need to claim money from them periodically. you can do this with `/workers claim`,
or by having worker notifications enabled. you will receive a dm with a button to claim money from
your workers

## how do i buy workers?

you can buy, upgrade and claim money from your workers using `/workers`

## rare upgrades

some upgrades for workers you cannot buy in the upgrade menu (launchpad, warehouse permit, nasa
computers), you must find these in crates, or buy from other players on auction or through trading.
